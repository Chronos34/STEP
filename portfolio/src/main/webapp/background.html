                Hello Guest! It is nice to meet you. I am Nana Baafi Agyekum,
                a student of <a href="https://www.rpi.edu/" id="school"
                title="Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute" target=_blank>RPI</a>. I 
                am a resident of Newark, New Jersey. I love to play soccer 
                and write poems. A fun fact, I have visited <i>three</i> 
                continents: <i>Africa, Europe</i> and <i>North America</i>. 
                I love to eat mashed plantain(the locals of Ghana call it etoo). 
                Here is a <a 
                href="https://awholelotofcole.wordpress.com/2019/10/08/etomore-than-just-food-its-culture/" 
                target=_blank>picture</a> of the dish. These are some of the 
                projects I have worked on:

                <ul>
                    <li>A basic Pokemon Game Simulation</li>
                    <li>The marketplace platform on Codecademy</li>
                    <li>A tourist sites search engine on Codecademy</li>
                </ul>

            </p>

            <p style="color:black">
                I recently realized I could write poems. I thought I had no talent for arts until
                I wrote my first poem. My audience loved it and can't wait to hear my next piece. 
                I would love to connect with you on <a 
                href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nanabaafiagyekum/" target=_blank>LinkedIn</a>. 
                This is my <a href="https://github.com/Chronos34" target=_blank>GitHub</a> profile.
