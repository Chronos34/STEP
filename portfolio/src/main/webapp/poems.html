            <h4>A CRYING WORLD</h4>
            <pre>
                
                Poverty, wealth,
                What is thy worth,
                From century to century,
                There cometh a new technology,
                For war or to assist in the domestics,
                We bring out crocodile tears and claim,
                Our people and other nationals are suffering,
                What is the cause of poverty ?
                How does wealth redeem,
                The question of the day is ?
                The nature of mankind,
                The answer, quite simple it is,
                Weapons of mass destruction,
                Biological and nuclear warfare,
                The rich preys on the poor,
                The strong on the weak,
                The intellectuals on the simpletons,
                We steal from others and,
                Deplete their resources,
                Not to make the globe benefit,
                But to destroy it,
                For the planet to achieve glorious wings,
                We need not terror create,
                We need not resources amass,
                But we need care and love,
                Even distribution of resources will help,
                The world achieves its angelic form.
